This project demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python, including inheritance and polymorphism. It features:

    A Smartphone class to represent a mobile phone with basic functions like making calls, sending messages, and displaying information.

    A Superhero class hierarchy demonstrating inheritance and polymorphism. Different superheroes (e.g., Superman, Spider-Man) implement their unique movement behavior.

    A Polymorphism Challenge where different vehicles (Car, Plane, Boat) implement the same move() method, each in their own way.

Features

    Smartphone Class: Contains attributes like brand, model, and storage. Methods include calling, sending messages, and displaying information.

    Superhero Class Hierarchy: Inheritance     allows different superheroes to have unique attributes and behavior (e.g., Superman flies, Spider-Man swings).

    Polymorphism: The move() method is implemented differently for each vehicle (Car, Plane, Boat), showcasing polymorphism in action.

Requirements

    Python 3.x

Usage

    Smartphone: Create an object representing a smartphone and call methods like call(), send_message(), and display_info().

    Superhero: Instantiate a superhero object (e.g., Superman or Spider-Man) and invoke move() and display_info().

    Polymorphism: Create a list of vehicles and call the move() method on each to see polymorphism in action.
